# Dockerized CTF-style Challenges

These Docker containers were originally made for the cyber@CIT club and aim to teach the basics of interacting with the Linux command line and common services. They are directed at beginners and cover aspects of the following:

- common Linux commands
- Linux file system structure
- connecting to remote services
- enumerating remote services

These can be expanded for more in-depth challenges and are easily customizable using the Dockerfiles.
